# Number Guessing Game

## Description
A console-based Number Guessing Game implemented in Java 17. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. Feedback is provided for each guess, and the game tracks the number of attempts.

## Requirements
- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA
- GitHub Copilot Plugin

## How to Play
1. Run the `NumberGuessApplication` class.
2. Enter a guess between 1 and 100.
3. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. The game tracks your attempts.
5. After guessing correctly, you can choose to play again.

## Features
- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Feedback for each guess
- Attempt tracking
- Option to play again

## Enhanced Features
- Set the range for the random number
- Scoring system
- Hints after a certain number of attempts
- High score tracking

## Using GitHub Copilot
- Code completion and context
- Chat interface for problem-solving
- Ghost text and code generation
- Inline chat and collaboration

## Chat Interface Assisted in Solving the Problem
While implementing the Number Guessing Game, I encountered a specific issue: validating user input to ensure that only valid numeric values are accepted. This involved handling potential exceptions when the input was not a number.

### Interaction with Copilot:
It provided a code snippet that included a try-catch block to handle NumberFormatException.

### Explanation of Assistance
#### Clarity and Precision:
The chat interface provided a clear and precise solution to my problem. It directly addressed the issue of input validation and showed how to handle exceptions in Java.

#### Efficiency:
Instead of searching for solutions online or in documentation, the chat interface quickly provided a relevant and correct solution, saving me time and effort.

#### Learning Opportunity:
By examining the suggested code, I learned how to implement input validation and exception handling in a clean and efficient manner. This improved my understanding of handling user input in Java.

#### Seamless Integration:
The chat interface is integrated within the development environment, making it easy to get help without switching contexts or interrupting my workflow.

#### Benefits of the Chat Interface
##### Real-time Assistance: Provides immediate solutions and suggestions, enhancing productivity.
##### Context-aware: Understands the context of the problem and offers relevant code snippets.
##### Learning Tool: Helps in learning best practices and efficient coding techniques by providing examples and explanations.
##### Code Quality: Improves code quality by suggesting robust and error-free code snippets.

## Best Practices for Using GitHub Copilot
### Dos:
- Review Suggestions Carefully
- Use Comments to Guide Copilot
- Use Copilot in conjunction with established best practices for coding, such as code reviews, testing, and documentation

### Don’ts:
- Don’t Over-rely on Copilot
- Don’t Ignore Security Considerations.
- Don’t Skip Code Reviews.

## Security and Privacy Considerations: Unauthorized Code Access
- Inadvertent Exposure

### Potential Impact of Unauthorized Access
- Data Breach
- Service Disruption
- Reputation Damage

### Preventive Measures to Avoid Accidental Exposure
- Use Environment Variables
- Regular Code Reviews and Audits
